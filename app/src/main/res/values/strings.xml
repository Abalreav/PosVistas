    <string name="text_contenido">Any band with a long history of theatrical shows reaches a time when it faces a choice to either strip everything down and get back to the music, man, or to somehow push the boat out even further. Iron Maiden’s Legacy of the Beast tour takes the latter course: it’s their most visually extravagant show ever. Their mascot, Eddie, appears first as a 12-foot trooper, swordfighting with singer Bruce Dickinson, and then as a stage-dwarfing demon. There are pyrotechnics, a giant noose and a vast model of Icarus. Most eye-popping of all is the 90% lifesize model of a second world war Spitfire, which “flies” over the stage and almost takes out drummer Nicko McBrain with its tailfin.

There is a point to all this. The usually crowd-bantering Dickinson announces that he’ll only speak to the audience once during the show, as he wants the “music and the images to tell the story”. Then he explains that they’ve just come back from Poland, where he discovered that the plane on which theirs is based – Spitfire Mk Vb AA853 from 302 Squadron – was flown by a Polish pilot. “Which is a weird coincidence. We forget that young people a third of my age were going off to fight against nazism, and the Spitfire is the symbol of that.” Then he introduces The Clansman, a song about the 13th-century Scottish knight William Wallace, who “stood up to the English king”, announcing: “There are people who are trying to fuck with our liberty and freedom.” </string>
